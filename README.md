# C Coursework Compilation

## Description

This is a compilation of code written during my completion of low level programming and operating systems based courses. The code is separated between low level basics and more complex operating systems concepts. I use this repository when refreshing and practicing C/C++ as I demonstrated use cases for many integral parts of the syntax and its many utilities.

## Table of Contents

| Directory | Nested Directories | Description |
| :-------: |  :---------: | :---------: |
| Low Level Basics | Array Mutability<br /><br />Basic IO<br /><br />Hex Playground<br /><br />Pile Game<br /><br />Pointers Basics<br /><br />String Library<br /><br />String Utilities<br /><br />Text File Parser<br /><br />Tortoise Hare Race | Low level basics represent a pre cursor to more substantial projects completed in relation to operating systems. This demonstrates very basic but fundamental elements of C programming and I frequently come back to it to refresh my lower level skillset. |
| Operating Systems | Event Simulator<br /><br />File System<br /><br />Networked Spellchecker<br /><br />Shell | This is a collection of four substantial projects completed during a pivotal capstone course during my undergraduate education. This explores how to build a task queue, a file system, a custom built shell, and a basic natworking system. |
