--ANALYSIS--

This base case uses some preliminary data to reach 1000+ queued jobs. From the base case it is easy to see that
to see that the number of jobs processed by the CPU is greatly larger than that of the disks. It is also noticeable
that significant backlog exists at the CPU since new tasks are appended to it at a far greater rate than I/O.
Utilization Remains low for the CPU likely because it is running efficient between time values 1 and 2.





--TEST CASE--
Next I will test the results of adjusting the the CPU min and max values to determine the effect on utilization.

The average size of the Event Queue is -- 23 jobs

--ANALYSIS--

Increasing the CPU time range caused the CPU utilization to spike as it was spending more time on jobs than before.
Additionally, because the CPU is responsible for sending jobs to disks, the disk utilization decreased, as did the
total number of jobs entered into the loop, it was roughly half the original.




--TEST CASE--

Compensating for the decrease in jobs, I will now double the finish time variable allowing more jobs to be processed. In addition to this increase,
I am adjusting the seed to determine the effect it has on the data.

--INPUT--

The throughput of the Disk 2 Queue is -- 38 Jobs



The average size of the Event Queue is -- 48 jobs

The maximum size of the Event Queue is -- 73 jobs

--ANALYSIS--

The seed had little effect on the data set as a whole, so the utilization and size values are stable.
The size of the CPU queue is staggeringly high despite its high utilization, indicating a back log in
CPU tasks that are not able to be processed.




--TEST CASE--

In a final test I adjusted the arrival min and max to see how the analytics would react.

--INPUT--

The average size of the CPU Queue is -- 5288 jobs

The maximum size of the CPU Queue is -- 10662 jobs

The CPU Utilization is -- 98.650002%

The throughput of the Disk 2 Queue is -- 40 Jobs



The average size of the Event Queue is -- 56 jobs

The maximum size of the Event Queue is -- 85 jobs

--ANALYSIS--

Decreasing this parameter increased the CPU to near max utilization and the log of items in the queue
was very large due to the inability to keep up with demand.




--TEST CASE--

A test was conducted to verify the functionality of the priority queue.

--INPUT--

    TESTING OF THE PRIORITY QUEUE; ALL EVENTS POP OFF

    randTime = Randomizer(ARRIVE_MIN,ARRIVE_MAX) + currentTime; jobTotal++;
    priorityAppend(&eventQueue,eventGenerator(randTime,jobTotal,ARRIVAL, 0),&eventSize);

    randTime = Randomizer(ARRIVE_MIN,ARRIVE_MAX) + currentTime; jobTotal++;
    priorityAppend(&eventQueue,eventGenerator(randTime,jobTotal,ARRIVAL, 0),&eventSize);

    randTime = Randomizer(ARRIVE_MIN,ARRIVE_MAX) + currentTime; jobTotal++;
    priorityAppend(&eventQueue,eventGenerator(randTime,jobTotal,ARRIVAL, 0),&eventSize);

    event task1 = priorityRemoveFirst(&eventQueue,&eventSize);
    printf("\n\n\n\n%d\n\n\n\n",task1.jobNumber);

    event task2 = priorityRemoveFirst(&eventQueue,&eventSize);
    printf("\n\n\n\n%d\n\n\n\n",task2.jobNumber);

    event task3 = priorityRemoveFirst(&eventQueue,&eventSize);
    printf("\n\n\n\n%d\n\n\n\n",task3.jobNumber);

--OUTPUT--

3 Removed Events

--ANALYSIS--

This test was done by commenting out the loop within the main function of the program and inserting 3 random
priority queue events. In running this sequence 3 job numbers are printed indicating they were effectively
popped off the stack.
